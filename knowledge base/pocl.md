# PoCL

Portable open source implementation of the 1.2 OpenCL standard.

Upstream PoCL currently supports various CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda, HSA-supported GPUs and TCE ASIPs (experimental, see: OpenASIP).

PoCL uses Clang as an OpenCL C frontend, and LLVM for kernel compiler implementation and as a portability layer.
