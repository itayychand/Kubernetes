# PoCL

PoCL is a portable open source implementation of the 1.2 OpenCL standard.

Upstream PoCL currently supports various CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda, HSA-supported GPUs and TCE ASIPs (experimental, see: OpenASIP).

PoCL uses Clang as an OpenCL C frontend and LLVM for kernel compiler implementation, and as a portability layer.
