## Troubleshooting

### Escape the backtick character

Include a non-code formatted backtick by escaping it normally (with a `\`).

Render it in an inline code block using double backticks instead of single backticks.

Alternatively, use a code block. This will wrap everything in a `<pre>` HTML tag.  
To do this, either indent 4 spaces to start a code block, or use fenced code blocks if supported.
