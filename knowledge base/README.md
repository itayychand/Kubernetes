# Knwoledge base

This is the collection of all notes, reminders and whatnot I gathered during the years.

## Conventions

- Use `sh` as document language instead of `shell` when writing shell snippets in code blocks:

  ```diff
  - ```shell
  + ```sh
  #!/usr/bin/env zsh
  ```

  The local renderer just displays them better like this.
