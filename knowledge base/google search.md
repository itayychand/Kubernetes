## TL;DR

- find an **exact phrase** enclosing it in _quotation marks_ (`""`); it will give back only results that include those same words in that same order:

  ```txt
  mama "i just killed a man"
  ```

- **exclude a word** from a search preceding it with a _minus sign_ (`-`); it will filter out unwanted results:

  ```txt
  how to scrub -tips
  ```

- find results that **include all of the words in a phrase** using the _asterisk symbol_ (`*`); it will give back results that include a specific phrase but may also have other words:

  ```txt
  how to clean * from sheets
  ```

- get results **from a particular website only** using the `site:` operator:

  ```txt
  site:wikipedia.org obama
  ```

  use the operator alone to determine whether Google has indexed a website:

  ```txt
  site:heyitsa.me
  ```
