# Useradd

Delete a user account and its related files.

## TL;DR

```shell
# Remove a user.
sudo userdel username

# Remove a user in other root directory.
sudo userdel --root path/to/other/root username

# Remove a user along with the home directory and mail spool.
sudo userdel --remove username
```
