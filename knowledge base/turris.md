## LED diodes settings

A permanent change of color can be set in the UCI configuration file `/etc/config/rainbow`.

The `rainbow` utility allows one to change the color and set the status of each diode individually. The setting are `disable` (off), `enable` (on) or `auto`; `auto` leaves the control of the diodes to the hardware, like blinking during data transfer and so on.

`rainbow`'s `brightness` subcommand uses numbers from 0 to 8, or from 0 to 255 if using the `-p` switch for higher precision.

### Automatic overnight dimming

Should you want to see the state of individual devices during day but not to be dazzled by the diodes in the night, you can automatically adjust the intensity of LEDs using a cronjob.

Create a text file in the `/etc/cron.d` directory:

```text
# File /etc/cron.d/rainbow_night.
# Set the light intensity to the second lowest degree every day at 11 PM and set
# it back to maximum every day at 7 AM.
MAILTO=""   # avoid automatic logging of the output
0  23  *  *  *  root   rainbow brightness 1
0   7  *  *  *  root   rainbow brightness 5
```

## Containerized pi-hole

> Requires the `lxc` package to be installed.

> Suggested the use of an [expansion disk](#hardware-upgrades).

See [Installing pi-hole on Turris Omnia], [Install Pi-hole] and [Pi-Hole on Turris Omnia] for details.

Choose one of Pi-hole's [supported operating systems][pi-hole supported operating systems], then follow this procedure:

1. In Turris OS:

   ```sh
   # Create the LXC container (pick one).
   lxc-create --name 'pi-hole' --template 'download' -- --dist 'debian' --release 'bullseye' --arch 'armhf' --server 'images.linuxcontainers.org'

   # Configure pi-hole's static IP lease.
   uci add dhcp host
   uci set dhcp.@host[-1].name='pi-hole'
   uci set dhcp.@host[-1].mac="$(grep hwaddr /srv/lxc/pi-hole/config | sed 's/.*= //')"
   uci set dhcp.@host[-1].ip='192.168.111.2'
   uci commit 'dhcp'
   luci-reload

   # Start it.
   lxc-start --name 'pi-hole'

   # Check it's running correctly.
   lxc-info --name 'pi-hole'

   # Get a shell to it.
   lxc-attach --name 'pi-hole'
   ```

1. In the container:

   ```sh
   # Set the correct hostname, if different from what is expected.
   hostnamectl set-hostname 'pi-hole'

   # Install pi-hole.
   DEBIAN_FRONTEND='noninteractive' apt-get install --assume-yes 'ca-certificates' 'curl'
   curl -sSL 'https://install.pi-hole.net' | bash

   # Follow the guided procedure.

   # Change the Web interface password, if needed.
   /etc/.pihole/pihole -a -p
   ```

1. Check all is working as expected.
1. Again in Turris OS:

   ```sh
   # Start pi-hole at boot
   vim '/etc/config/lxc-auto'
   ```

   ```text
   config container
       option name pi-hole
       option timeout 60
   ```

   ```sh
   # Distribute pi-hole as the primary DNS.
   # Keep the router as secondary.
   uci set dhcp.lan.dhcp_option='6,192.168.111.2,192.168.111.1'

   # The dns server address in the IPv6 RA should be the container's ULA address
   # since the global routable IPv6 address tend to change daily.
   uci add_list dhcp.lan.dns="$(lxc-info --name pi-hole | grep -E 'IP.* f[cd]' | sed 's/IP: *//')"

   # Apply the new configuration.
   uci commit 'dhcp' && luci-reload
   /etc/init.d/odhcpd restart
   /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
   ```

## Factory reset

Keep pressed the reset button on the back panel and wait for LEDs to indicate the number of the desired mode, then release the reset button.

The LEDs are used as a counter, with the number of lid LEDs (regardless of the color) indicating the reset mode the router will reboot into. The LEDs will transition from green to red, and when the last LED turns red the next LED will light up and the counter is incremented. When the counter reaches 12 (the total number of LEDs), it will start again from 1.

When the reset button is released, the LED counter will blink three times to confirm the selected reset mode. If the selected mode is different from the required one, just press the reset button again and start the mode selection process again.

Available reset modes are:

- 1 LED: standard (re)boot
- 2 LEDs: rollback to latest snapshot
- 3 LEDs: rollback to factory reset
- 4 LEDs: re-flash the router from a flash drive
- 5 LEDs: enable an insecure SSH on 192.168.1.1 (Omnia 2019 and newer)
- 6 LEDs: re-flash from the Internet (Omnia 2019 and newer)
- 7 LEDs: start a rescue shell

> **Tip:** release the reset button immediately after the required number of LEDs starts shining (regardless of the color). Do not unnecessarily prolong holding the reset button when the last LED is lit. By doing this you decrease a chance of accidentally transitioning to the next mode at the same moment when the button is released.

After the selected mode indication is performed, all LEDs will turn blue for a moment and then a light wave indicates the start the first stage boot during which LEDs turn green.

> **Warning:** when LEDs turn red, it means that some highly sensitive operation is in process and data may be corrupted if it is interrupted. Try not to reset router during the process or you might end up with corrupted filesystem. That one can be fixed using mode 4 but with complete data loss.
